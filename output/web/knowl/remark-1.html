<div class="para">It would seem that by symmetry one ought to be able to show <span class="process-math">\(I(V(J)) = J\)</span> holds for any radical ideal in the same manner that we proved <span class="process-math">\(V(I(W)) = W\)</span> for any affine variety <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> but this does not work as the previous example shows. What goes wrong? The symmetric proof does show that <span class="process-math">\(I(V(J)) = J\)</span> <em class="emphasis">for any ideal <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> that has the form <span class="process-math">\(I(W)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span></em>, but it is not true that every radical ideal <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> is of this form for any field. Indeed, for <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> as in the previous example, <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> is a radical ideal and yet <span class="process-math">\(J \ne I(W)\)</span> for any subset <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{A}^n_{\mathbb{R}}\text{.}\)</span>
