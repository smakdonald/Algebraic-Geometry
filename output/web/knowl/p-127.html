<div class="para">Recall that a <em class="emphasis">topology</em> on a set <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a specified collection of subsets, known as the <em class="emphasis">open subsets</em>, such that (1) <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is an open subset of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> (2) <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\)</span> is an open subset of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> (3) the intersection of any two open subsets it open, and (4) an arbitrary union of open subsets is open. Such a specified collection of open subsets makes <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> into a <em class="emphasis">topological space</em>. In any topological space, a <em class="emphasis">closed subset</em> is any subset that is the complement of an open one. One may equivalently describe a topology as a collection of specified “closed subsets” such that (1) <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is an closed subset of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> (2) <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset\)</span> is an closed subset of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> (3) the intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed subsets is closed, and (4) the union of two closed subsets is closed. By what we have proved above about affine varieties, we may define:</div>
