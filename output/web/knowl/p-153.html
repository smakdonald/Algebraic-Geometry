<em class="emphasis">Remark 1</em>.  In general, if <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is any noetherian topological space (i.e., a space with dcc for closed subsets), then the conclusion of the previous Corollary holds. The existence is given as follows: If <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is irreducible, then we may take <span class="process-math">\(m = 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(X_1 = X\text{.}\)</span> If not, then <span class="process-math">\(X = X_1 \cup Y_1\)</span> for two proper closed subsets <span class="process-math">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> If both <span class="process-math">\(X_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\)</span> are irreducible, we are done; otherwise we can decompose at least one of them â€” without loss say it is <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\)</span> that decomposes. Then <span class="process-math">\(Y_1 = X_2 \cup Y_2\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(X_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y_2\)</span> closed a proper in <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\text{.}\)</span> Continuing in the fashion gives a strictly descending chain <span class="process-math">\(X \supsetneq Y_1 \subsetneq Y_2 \subsetneq\)</span> of closed subsets. By dcc, this process must stop after a finite number of steps, and thus <span class="process-math">\(X = X_1 \cup \cdots \cup X_m\)</span> for some irreducible closed subsets <span class="process-math">\(X_1, \dots, X_m\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(X_i \subseteq X_j\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(i \ne j\text{,}\)</span> delete <span class="process-math">\(X_i\)</span> from the list.</div>
