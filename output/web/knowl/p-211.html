<dfn class="terminology">Example 1</dfn>.  Let <span class="process-math">\(X = V(xy,xz)\text{,}\)</span> the union of the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis and the <span class="process-math">\(yz\)</span>-plane. The dimension of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is two. It is clearly at least two, since we have the chain with <span class="process-math">\(Y_0\)</span> being any point on the <span class="process-math">\(yz\)</span>-plane, <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\)</span> being any line in this plane and containing this point, and <span class="process-math">\(Y_2\)</span> being the whole plane. It is harder to see that it is at most two. This is an example of a variety that fails to be “equi-dimensional” — the variety has two irreducible components, but they have different dimensions.</div>
