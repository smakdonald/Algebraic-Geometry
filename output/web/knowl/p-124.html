<div class="para">Note that <span class="process-math">\(A(W)\)</span> is a reduced ring since <span class="process-math">\(I(W)\)</span> is a radical ideal. Moreover, provided <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is algebraically closed, every finitely generated, commutative, reduced <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-algebra occurs, up to isomorphism, as the coordinate ring of some affine variety: Given such an algebra <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> being finitely generated as a <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-algebra means there is a surjection <span class="process-math">\(k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \twoheadrightarrow A\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is reduced, the kernel <span class="process-math">\(J\)</span> is a radical ideal. Taking <span class="process-math">\(W = V(J)\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(I(W) =I(V( J)) = J\)</span> by the Nullstellensatz and hence <span class="process-math">\(A(W) \cong A\text{.}\)</span> The assumption that <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is algebraically closed is needed here, due to examples such that <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb{R}}[x]/(x^2 + 1)\text{.}\)</span>
