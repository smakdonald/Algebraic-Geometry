          I am very thankful to Eloísa, Alexandra, and Mark for sharing their <em>.tex</em> files with me, despite the fact that they had no idea what I would be doing with them. Fittingly, I would also like to acknowledge Eloísa for having an acknowledgement section in her lecture notes, yielding a template for my own.

        <p>
          I'm still in the process of figuring out exactly what this is for. Some possibilities include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Future lecture notes for the hopeful possibility that one day I will teach a course over this material.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Current notes for students taking the first year algebra sequence. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Assistance in studying for the Algebra Qualifying Exam at UNL.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Clout.

            Here are the types of environments you are likely to encounter throughout the text and what they are used for.
            <ul>
              <li><title><term>Definition</term></title>
                <p>
                  These are pretty standard and probably what you'd be expecting. 
                  The building blocks of what we'll be working with. 
                </p>
              </li>

              <li><title><term>Examples</term></title>
                <p>
                  Specific instances of a definition.
                  For example, the empty set, <m>\emptyset</m> is an example of a set, and thus would be contained within an <q>example</q> environment.
                  At some point the line between example and definition becomes incoherently blurred, but I have done my best to keep things consistent.
                </p>

              <li><title><term>Theorem</term></title>

                  A result.

              <p>
                Never use the words "obvious", "clearly", "trivial", "of course", or synonyms of these.

            <li>
              <p>
                Write words rather than symbols or abbreviations - a long string of symbols isn't as readable as an English sentence. 
                Specifically: For all proofs you hand in, write out "for all", "there is", "implies", "if and only if", "therefore", "because", "such that", "for example". 
                (That is, the symbols ∀, ∃, ⇒, ⇔, ∴, ∵, and s.t., should be avoided.)

                Every time you apply a definition, theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, exercise, etc., in a proof that you are writing up, reference it. 
                Reference a theorem, lemma, or proposition by its number in the text; reference a definition as "the definition of ___" (or by its number in the text).

            <li>

          Throughout this class, <m>k</m> will always denote a field and we will often assume that <m>k</m> is an algebraically closed field. 
          It will rarely cause problems to assume <m>k = \mathbb{C}</m>, in fact.

              For an arbitrary field <m>k</m>, <em>affine <m>n</m>-space</em> over <m>k</m>, written <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m>, is the set of <m>n</m>-tuples of elements of <m>k</m>:

        <p>
          So, <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> is just <m>k^n</m>, but we avoid using the latter since <m>k^n</m> is the usual notation of the standard <m>n</m>-dimensional <m>k</m>-vector space. Affine space is not thought of as a vector space typically.

            \langle S \rangle= \{f_1 g_1 + \cdots + f_m g_m \mid m \geq 0, f_i \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n], g_i \in S, \text{ for all $i$}\}.
          </me> 
          For any ideal <m>I</m>, we let <m>\sqrt{I} = \{f \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \mid f^m \in I, \text{ for some $m \geq 1$}\}</m>, the <em>radical of <m>I</m></em>. 
          The radical of an ideal is again an ideal.

            <p>
              For any subset <m>S</m> of <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m> we have <me>V(S) = V(\langle S \rangle) = V(\sqrt{\langle S \rangle }).</me> In particular, <m>V(I) = V(\sqrt{I})</m> for any ideal <m>I</m>.
            </p>

          <proof>
            <p>
              The containments <m>\supseteq</m> hold since <m>S \subseteq \langle S \rangle  \subseteq \sqrt{(S)}</m>. 
              Say <m>P \in V(S)</m>. 
              An arbitrary element of <m>\langle S \rangle</m> has the form <m>f  = f_1 g_1 + \cdots + f_m g_m</m> with <m>f_i \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m> and <m>g_i \in S</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
              We have <m>f(P) = \sum_i f_i(P) g_i(P) = \sum_i f_i(P) \cdot 0 = 0</m>. 
              This proves <m>V(S) = V(\langle S \rangle)</m>. 
              Given any ideal <m>I</m>, if <m>P \in V(I)</m> and <m>f</m> is such that <m>f^n \in I</m>, then <m>f(P)^n = (f^n)(P) = 0</m> and hence <m>f(P) = 0</m>. 
              This proves <m>V(I) = V(\sqrt{I})</m>.

				  Thanks to this proposition, we can redifine an affine variety to be a subset of the form <m>V(J)</m> where <m>J</m> is an ideal (or even a radical ideal).

                    In particular, the union of a pair of affine varieties in <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> is again an affine variety.

                    If <m>\{I_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}</m> is any collection of ideals of <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m>, then

          <proof>
            <p>
              I’ll just prove the second one: If <m>P \in V(I) \cup V(J)</m> then for all <m>f \in I</m>, <m>g \in J</m> we have <m>(fg)(P) = f(P) g(P) = 0</m> since either <m>f(P) = 0</m> or <m>g(P) = 0</m>. 
              Thus <m>P \in V(\{f g \mid f \in I, g \in J\}) = V(IJ)</m>, where the last equality uses <xref ref="prop-locus-radical" />.
            </p>

            <p>
              Say <m>P \notin V(I) \cup V(J)</m>. 
              Then for any <m>f \in I, g \in J'</m>, we have <m>f(P) \ne 0</m> and <m>g(P) \ne 0</m> and thus <m>(fg)(P) = f(P) g(P) \ne 0</m>. 
              This proves <m>P \notin V(\{f g \mid f \in I, g \in J\}) = V(IJ)</m>.

              By <xref ref="prop-locus-radical" /> we may assume <m>V = V(I)</m> for a (radical) ideal <m>I</m>. By the HBT we have <m>I = \langle g_1, \dots, g_m \rangle</m> for some <m>g_i</m>’s and hence (using the Proposition again) <m>V = V(g_1, \dots, g_m)</m>.

          <proof>
            <p>
              If <m>f \in J</m>, then for each <m>P \in V(J)</m> we have, by definition, that <m>f(P) = 0</m> and hence, again by definition, <m>f \in I(V(J))</m>. 
              Note that this remains valid if <m>J</m> is any subset.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the second one, pick <m>P \in W</m>. 
              For any <m>f \in I(W)</m> we have, by definition, <m>f(P) = 0</m>. 
              Again by definition this means <m>P \in V(I(W))</m>. 
              Thus <m>W \subseteq V(I(W))</m>. 
              Note that this containment holds if <m>W</m> is any subset. 
              Now assume <m>W</m> is an affine variety. 
              Then <m>W = V(J)</m> for some radical ideal <m>J</m>. 
              By the first part we have <m>I(V(J)) \supseteq J</m> and hence <m>V(I(V(J))) \subseteq V(J)</m>. 
              Substituting <m>W</m> for <m>V(J)</m> yields <m>V(I(W)) \subseteq W</m> and hence <m>V(I(W)) = W</m>.
            </p>
          </proof>
        </proposition>

        <p>
          Can you find an example where the containment <m>I(V(J)) \supseteq J</m> is strict, say for the ring <m>{\mathbb{R}}</m>?
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Here is one:
        </p>

        <example>
          <p>
            Take <m>J = \langle x^2 + y^2 \rangle</m> and <m>k = {\mathbb{R}}</m>, and note that <m>J</m> is a radical ideal since <m>x^2+y^2</m> is an irreducible polynomial (why?). 
            We have <m>V(J) = \{(0,0)\}</m> and so <m>I(V(J)) = \langle x,y \rangle \supsetneq J</m>.
          </p>
        </example>

        <remark>
          <p>
            It would seem that by symmetry one ought to be able to show <m>I(V(J)) = J</m> holds for any radical ideal in the same manner that we proved <m>V(I(W)) = W</m> for any affine variety <m>W</m>, but this does not work as the previous example shows. 
            What goes wrong? The symmetric proof does show that <m>I(V(J)) = J</m> <em>for any ideal <m>J</m> that has the form <m>I(W)</m> for some <m>W</m></em>, but it is not true that every radical ideal <m>J</m> is of this form for any field. 
            Indeed, for <m>J</m> as in the previous example, <m>J</m> is a radical ideal and yet <m>J \ne I(W)</m> for any subset <m>W</m> of <m>\mathbb{A}^n_{\mathbb{R}}</m>.

              Thus, there is a order-reversing bijection between the poset (under containment) of all affine varieties in <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> and the poset (under containment) of all radical ideals in <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m>.

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let now <m>J</m> be any ideal of <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m>. 
              We need to show that <m>I(V(J)) \subseteq \sqrt{J}</m>. 
              Pick <m>f \in I(V(J))</m>; that is, assume <m>f</m> is a polynomial such that <m>f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = 0</m> for every <m>(a_1, \dots, a_n) \in V(J)</m>. 
              It suffices to prove <m>f^m = 0</m> in the quotient ring <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/J</m> for some <m>m \geq 1</m>, for this implies <m>f \in \sqrt{J}</m>.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Let <m>L</m> be the ideal of <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y]</m> generated by (the image of) <m>J</m> and <m>1 - yf(x_1, \dots, x_n)</m>. 
              I claim <m>V(L)</m> is the empty set: If <m>(a_1, \dots, a_n, b) \in V(L)</m> then <m>(a_1, \dots, a_n) \in V(J)</m> and so <m>f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = 0</m>. 
              But we also have <m>b f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = 1</m>, which is impossible.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Since <m>V(L) = \emptyset</m>, by the Weak Nullstellensatz we must have <m>L = \langle 1 \rangle</m>.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Now, by <xref ref="lem122" /> there is an isomorphism 
              <me>
                \frac{(k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/J) [ y]}{(1 - yf)} \xrightarrow{\cong} S^{-1} k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/J
              </me> 
              of commutative rings, where <m>S = \{f^m \mid m \geq 1\}</m>. 
              We also have the canonical isomorphism 
              <me>
                \frac{(k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/J) [ y]}{(1 - yf)} \cong \frac{(k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y]}{\langle J \rangle + (1 - yf)} = k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y]/L.
              </me> 
              Since <m>L = \langle 1 \rangle</m>, this proves that <m>S^{-1} (k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/J)</m> is the trivial ring, and hence <m>\frac{1}{1} = \frac{0}{1}</m> in this ring. 
              Thus <m>f^m = 0</m> in <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/J</m> for some <m>m</m>.

            The only new/non-elementary assertion in the Strong Nullstellensatz <m>I(V(J))\subseteq J</m>.
            This can be rephrased as: Suppose <m>f</m> is a polynomial and <m>J</m> is an ideal such that <m>f \in I(V(J))</m>. 
            Then some power of <m>f</m> belongs to <m>J</m>.

            In other words, if, starting with the system of equations <m>g_1 = 0, \dots, g_m = 0</m>, adding on <m>f = 0</m> has no effect on the solution set, then it is because the new equation is an <q>algebraic consequence</q> of the previous — that is, <m>f</m> is an <m>m</m>-th root of some <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m>-linear combination of the <m>g_i</m>’s. 
            (Note that the converse is obvious, and holds for any field: if <m>f = 0</m> is an <q>algebraic consequence</q> of the previous equations, then adding it to the list has no effect on the solution set.)

          <statement>
            <p>
              For an algebraically closed field <m>k</m>, every maximal ideal of <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m> is of the form <m>(x_1 - a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n)</m> for elements <m>a_1, \dots, a_n \in k</m>. 
              In fact, the function

              sending <m>(a_1 \dots, a_n)</m> to <m>(x_1 - a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n)</m> is a bijection.
            </p>
          </statement>

          <proof>

            <p>
              We will prove this Corollary, taking the Abstract Nullstellensatz on faith.
            </p>

            <p>
              The function is clearly well-defined (i.e., <m>(x_1 - a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n)</m> is a maximal ideal for any choice of <m>a_i</m>’s) and one-to-one. 
              (If <m>a_i \ne a_i'</m> for at least one value of <m>i</m>, then <m>(x_1 - a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n)</m> and <m>(x_1 - a'_1, \dots, x_n - a'_n)</m> are distinct ideals). 
              The surjectivity uses the Abstract Nullstellensatz:
            </p>

            <p>
              Let <m>{\mathfrak m}\in \operatorname{mSpec}k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m> and consider the composition <m>\phi: k \hookrightarrow k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/{\mathfrak m}</m> of canonical ring maps <m>k \hookrightarrow k[x_1, \dots, x_n] \twoheadrightarrow k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/{\mathfrak m}</m>. 
              (It is injective since <m>k</m> is a field.) 
              By the Abstract Nullstellensatz, it is a finite field extension. 
              But since <m>k</m> is algebraically closed, it must be an isomorphism. 
              Let <m>a_i = \phi^{-1}(\overline{x_i})</m>. 
              Then it follows that <m>\overline{x_i - a_i} = 0</m> — i.e., <m>x_i - a_i \in {\mathfrak m}</m> for all <m>i</m>. 
              Thus <m>{\mathfrak m}\supseteq (x_1 - a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n)</m> and since the latter is maximal, we must in fact have an equality.
            </p>

            When <m>n = 1</m>, the Corollary holds essentially by definition of <q>algebraically</q> closed: If <m>{\mathfrak m}</m> is any maximal ideal of <m>k[x]</m>, then <m>{\mathfrak m}= \langle p(x) \rangle</m> for a unique irreducible, monic polynomial <m>p(x)</m>. 
            If <m>k</m> is algebraically closed, <m>p(x)</m> must be linear and thus of the form <m>(x- a)</m> for some <m>a \in k</m>.

            The proof shows, more generally, that for any field <m>k</m>, there is a bijection between <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> and the subset of those maximal ideals <m>{\mathfrak m}</m> in <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m> for which the canonical map of fields <m>k \to k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/{\mathfrak m}</m> is an isomorphism.

                \langle x_1 - a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n \rangle= I(\{(a_1, \dots, a_n)\} \supseteq I(V(J))) \supseteq J.
              </me> 
              The Nullstellensatz implies it is onto: If <m>{\mathfrak m}\in \operatorname{mSpec}(k[x_1, \dots, x_n]/J)</m> then <m>{\mathfrak m}= \tilde{{\mathfrak m}}/J</m> for some <m>\tilde{{\mathfrak m}} \in \operatorname{mSpec}k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m>, and by the (Corollary to the) Nullstellensatz <m>\tilde{{\mathfrak m}} = (x_1 - a_1, \dots, x_n - a_n)</m> for some <m>a_1, \dots, a_n \in k</m>.

        <p>
          For simplicity, we will assume <m>k</m> is algebraically closed from now on. 
          This is not really needed for many of the statements that follow, but it will be tedious to keep track of which ones really do, and in some cases where it is not needed, the proofs are harder without that assumption.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Recall that a <em>topology</em> on a set <m>X</m> is a specified collection of subsets, known as the <em>open subsets</em>, such that 
          (1) <m>X</m> is an open subset of <m>X</m>, 
          (2) <m>\emptyset</m> is an open subset of <m>X</m>, 
          (3) the intersection of any two open subsets it open, and 
          (4) an arbitrary union of open subsets is open. 
          Such a specified collection of open subsets makes <m>X</m> into a <em>topological space</em>. 
          In any topological space, a <em>closed subset</em> is any subset that is the complement of an open one. 
          One may equivalently describe a topology as a collection of specified <q>closed subsets</q> such that 
          (1) <m>X</m> is an closed subset of <m>X</m>, 
          (2) <m>\emptyset</m> is an closed subset of <m>X</m>, 
          (3) the intersection of an arbitrary collection of closed subsets is closed, and 
          (4) the union of two closed subsets is closed. 
          By what we have proved above about affine varieties, we may define:
        </p>
  
  <!-- div attr= class="defn"-->
        <p>
          <term>Definition 1</term>.  The <em>Zariski topology</em> on <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> is the topology in which a subset is closed if and only if it is an affine variety (i.e., cut out by a collection of polynomial equations). Given a variety <m>X</m> in <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m>, the <em>Zariski topology</em> on <m>X</m> is the subspace topology — since <m>X</m> is closed in <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m>, this means that a subset <m>C</m> of <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>C</m> is an affine subvariety of <m>X</m> (i.e., an affine variety in <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> that is contained in <m>X</m>).
        </p><!--</div attr= class="defn">-->
  
        <p>
          So, a subset <m>U</m> of <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> is open iff <m>U = \mathbb{A}^n_k \setminus V(J)</m> for some ideal <m>J</m> (which we may take to be radical), and more generally a subset of an affine variety <m>X</m> is open iff it has the form <m>X \setminus V(J)</m> for some ideal <m>J</m> in <m>A(X)</m>.
        </p>
  
  <!-- div attr= class="rem"-->
        <p>
          <em>Remark 1</em>.  The Zariski topology on <m>\mathbb{A}^n_k</m> is not Hausdorff (provided <m>n &gt; 0</m>). Indeed, the intersection of any two non-empty open sets is non-empty. This is equivalent to the assertion that the union of any two proper closed subset is proper. Using the Nullstellensatz, this is equivalent to the assertion that if <m>I</m> and <m>J</m> are any two non-zero ideals of <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m> then <m>I \cap J</m> is non-zero, and that holds since <m>k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m> is a domain.

          <term>Proposition 1</term>.  <em>Every affine variety <m>X</m> is (quasi-)compact for the Zariski topology — that is, every open cover of <m>X</m> by Zariski open subsets admits a finite subcover or, equivalently, if <m>\{C_\alpha\}</m> is a collection of closed subsets of <m>X</m> such that <m>\bigcap_\alpha C_\alpha= \emptyset</m> then <m>C_{\alpha_1} \cap \cdots \cap C_{\alpha_m}  = \emptyset</m> for some finite list <m>\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m</m> of indices.</em>

        </p><!--</div attr= class="prop">-->
  
  <!-- div attr= class="proof"-->
        <p>
          <em>Proof.</em> We may translate the first assertion into a statement about ideals in the ring <m>R = A(X)</m>: We need to prove that if <m>\{I_\alpha\}</m> is a collection of ideals such that <m>\sum_{\alpha} I_\alpha= R</m> then <m>I_{\alpha_1} + \cdots + I_{\alpha_m} = R</m> for some finite sub-collection. This holds since <m>\sum_{\alpha} I_\alpha= R</m> iff <m>1 \in \sum_{\alpha} I_\alpha</m> iff <m>1 \in I_{\alpha_1} + \cdots + I_{\alpha_m}</m> for some <m>\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_m</m>.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          I’ll just sketch the proof of the second assertion: Let <m>U</m> be an open subset of an affine variety <m>X</m>, say <m>U = X
  \setminus V_X(J)</m> for an ideal <m>J</m>. We have <m>J = \langle g_1, \dots, g_m \rangle</m> (Hilbert Basis Theorem), and so <m>U = \bigcup_{i=1}^m X \setminus V(g_i)</m>. Since this is a finite union, it suffices to show each <m>X \setminus V(g_i)</m> is quasi-compact. So, without loss, we may assume <m>U = X \setminus V(g)</m> for some <m>g</m>. The points of <m>U</m> are in bijective correspondence with the maximal ideals of the ring <m>A(X)[1/g]</m> and the closed subsets are given by ideals of this ring. So, the same proof as in the first part applies. ◻

    \cup Z</m> with <m>Y</m> and <m>Z</m> affine subvarieties of <m>X</m>, we have <m>Y = X</m> or <m>Z = X</m>.

          <em>Proof.</em> If <m>X</m> is not irreducible, then <m>X = Y \cup Z</m> for proper closed subsets <m>Y</m> and <m>Z</m> of <m>X</m>. It follows that <m>I(X) \subsetneq I(Y)</m>, <m>I(X) \subsetneq I(Z)</m>, and <m>I(X) = I(Y) \cap I(Z)</m>. So pick <m>g \in I(Y) \setminus I(X)</m> and <m>g \in I(Z) \setminus I(X)</m>. Then <m>fg \in I(X)</m>, proving <m>I(X)</m> is not prime.

          Suppose <m>I(X)</m> is not prime. Then there are polynomials <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> neither of which is in <m>I(X)</m> and yet <m>fg \in I(X)</m>. Set <m>J = I(X) + \langle f \rangle</m> and <m>L = I(X) + \langle g \rangle</m> and <m>Y = V(J)</m> and <m>Z = V(L)</m>. Then <m>Y \subsetneq X</m>, <m>Z \subseteq X</m> and <m>Y \cup Z = V(I) \cup V(L) = V(I \cdot L) = V(X)</m> since <m>I \cdot L = I(X)</m>.

          For the second assertion, we already know there is a bijective correspondence between affine subvarieties of an affine variety <m>V</m> and radical ideals of <m>A(V)</m>, given by <m>W \mapsto I(W)/I(V)</m>.

          <term>Corollary 1</term>.  <em>Every affine variety <m>X</m> is a finite union of irreducible closed subsets, <m>X = X_1 \cup \cdots \cup X_m</m>, such that <m>X_i \not\subseteq X_j</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m>.

          <em>Remark 1</em>.  In general, if <m>X</m> is any noetherian topological space (i.e., a space with dcc for closed subsets), then the conclusion of the previous Corollary holds. The existence is given as follows: If <m>X</m> is irreducible, then we may take <m>m = 1</m> and <m>X_1 = X</m>. If not, then <m>X = X_1 \cup Y_1</m> for two proper closed subsets <m>X_1</m> and <m>Y_1</m> of <m>X</m>. If both <m>X_1</m> and <m>Y_1</m> are irreducible, we are done; otherwise we can decompose at least one of them — without loss say it is <m>Y_1</m> that decomposes. Then <m>Y_1 = X_2 \cup Y_2</m> with <m>X_2</m> and <m>Y_2</m> closed a proper in <m>Y_1</m>. Continuing in the fashion gives a strictly descending chain <m>X \supsetneq Y_1 \subsetneq Y_2 \subsetneq</m> of closed subsets. By dcc, this process must stop after a finite number of steps, and thus <m>X = X_1 \cup \cdots \cup X_m</m> for some irreducible closed subsets <m>X_1, \dots, X_m</m>. If <m>X_i \subseteq X_j</m> for some <m>i \ne j</m>, delete <m>X_i</m> from the list.

  <!-- div attr= class="defn"-->
        <p>
          <term>Definition 1</term>.  A <em>distinguished open subset</em> of an affine variety <m>X</m> is an open subset of the form <me>D_X(f) = \{ P \in X \mid f(P) \ne 0\}</me> for some element <m>f \in A(X)</m>. (We can also think of <m>D_X(f) = X \cap D(f)</m> for <m>f \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n]</m>.)

          <term>Exercise 1</term>.  Let <m>X</m> be any affine variety.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Show <m>D_X(f) \cap D_X(g) = D_X(fg)</m>; in particular, the intersection of any two distinguished open subsets of <m>X</m> is again distinguished.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Show that the collection of distinguished open subsets of <m>X</m> form a <q>basis</q> for the Zariski topology on <m>X</m>. Recall that a collection of subsets <m>\mathcal B</m> for a set <m>T</m> is a <em>basis for a topology</em> if:
        </p>
  
        <p><ul>
          <li>
                <p>
          for every point <m>P</m> there is a <m>U \in \mathcal B</m> with <m>P \in U</m> and
        </p>
          </li>
  
          <li>
                <p>
          whenever <m>P \in U_1 \cap U_2</m> for some <m>U_1, U_2 \in \mathcal B</m>, there is a <m>U_3 \in \mathcal B</m> such that <m>P \in U_3 \subseteq U_1 \cap U_2</m>.
        </p>
          </li>
  
        </ul></p>
  
        <p>
          And the topology generated by such a basis is the collection of subsets of <m>T</m> that are arbitrary unions of members of <m>\mathcal B</m>. So, you are being asked to show the above two properties hold for the collection of distinguished open sets and that every Zariski open set is a union of distinguished ones.

          <term>Definition 1</term>.  The <em>dimension</em> of a noetherian topological space <m>X</m>, written <m>\operatorname{dim}(X) \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, \infty\}</m>, is the supremum of the set of all integers <m>n \geq 0</m> such that there exists a chain <me>\emptyset \subsetneq Y_0 \subsetneq Y_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Y_n \subseteq X</me> with each <m>Y_i</m> an irreducible closed subset of <m>X</m>.

          <em>Remark 1</em>.  Note that we only define codimension when <m>Y</m> is irreducible. When <m>Y</m> is reducible, sometimes one defines <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Y)</m> to be the <em>minimum</em> value of <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Y')</m> where <m>Y'</m> ranges over the irreducible components of <m>Y</m>.

Then <m>\mathbb{N}</m> is a noetherian space but has infinite dimension. There exist noetherian commutative rings <m>R</m> such that <m>\operatorname{dim}\operatorname{Spec}(R) = \infty</m>.

          <em>Remark 1</em>.  Observe that every maximal chain of irreducible closed subsets (i.e., every chain that cannot be made longer and inserting new terms) of <m>X</m> has <m>Y_n</m> equal to an irreducible component of <m>X</m> and has <m>Y_0</m> equal to a single point.

          <term>Example 1</term>.  Let <m>X = V(xy,xz)</m>, the union of the <m>x</m>-axis and the <m>yz</m>-plane. The dimension of <m>X</m> is two. It is clearly at least two, since we have the chain with <m>Y_0</m> being any point on the <m>yz</m>-plane, <m>Y_1</m> being any line in this plane and containing this point, and <m>Y_2</m> being the whole plane. It is harder to see that it is at most two. This is an example of a variety that fails to be <q>equi-dimensional</q> — the variety has two irreducible components, but they have different dimensions.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Let <m>Y = V(x) \subseteq X</m>, the <m>yz</m>-plane. Then <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Y) = 0</m> since the only closed subsets strictly between <m>Y</m> and <m>X</m> are given by <m>Y</m> together with a finite set of points on the line.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Let <m>Z = V(y,z)</m>, the <m>x</m>-axis. Then <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Z)</m> is also <m>0</m> by similar reasoning. Since <m>\operatorname{dim}(Z)  = 1</m>, this is a bit counter-intuitive.

It follows that <m>\max \{ \operatorname{dim}V_X(f) \cap X_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq k\} =\operatorname{dim}(X) - 1</m>.

          <term>Definition 1</term>.  The <em>dimension</em> of a noetherian topological space <m>X</m>, written <m>\operatorname{dim}(X) \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, \infty\}</m>, is the supremum of the set of all integers <m>n \geq 0</m> such that there exists a chain <me>\emptyset \subsetneq Y_0 \subsetneq Y_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Y_n \subseteq X</me> with each <m>Y_i</m> an irreducible closed subset of <m>X</m>. (The dimension of the empty set is <m>-\infty</m>. It is possible that the dimension of a noetherian space is infinite.)

          Given a closed irreducible subset <m>Y</m> of <m>X</m>, the <em>codimension</em> of <m>Y</m> in <m>X</m>, written <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Y)</m>, the supremum over all <m>n</m> such that a choice of the form <me>Y = Y_0 \subsetneq Y_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Y_n \subseteq X.</me>

          <em>Remark 1</em>.  Note that we only define codimension when <m>Y</m> is irreducible. When <m>Y</m> is reducible, sometimes one defines <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Y)</m> to be the <em>minimum</em> value of <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Y')</m> where <m>Y'</m> ranges over the irreducible components of <m>Y</m>.

          <em>Remark 1</em>.  Topologize <m>\mathbb{N}</m> by declaring a subset to be closed if and only if it is of the form <m>\{0, 1, \dots, n\}</m> for some <m>-1 \leq n \leq \infty</m>. Then <m>\mathbb{N}</m> is a noetherian space but has infinite dimension. There exist noetherian commutative rings <m>R</m> such that <m>\operatorname{dim}\operatorname{Spec}(R) = \infty</m>. (This cannot occur for local rings nor for rings that are finitely generated as <m>k</m>-algebras.)

          <em>Remark 1</em>.  Observe that every maximal chain of irreducible closed subsets (i.e., every chain that cannot be made longer and inserting new terms) of <m>X</m> has <m>Y_n</m> equal to an irreducible component of <m>X</m> and has <m>Y_0</m> equal to a single point. In particular, <me>\operatorname{dim}(X) = \max \{\operatorname{dim}(Y) \mid \text{$Y$ is an irreducible component of $X$}\}</me> and <me>\operatorname{dim}(X) = \max \{\operatorname{codim}_X(P) \mid \text{$P$ is any point of $X$}\}.</me>

          <term>Example 1</term>.  Let <m>X = V(xy,xz)</m>, the union of the <m>x</m>-axis and the <m>yz</m>-plane. The dimension of <m>X</m> is two. It is clearly at least two, since we have the chain with <m>Y_0</m> being any point on the <m>yz</m>-plane, <m>Y_1</m> being any line in this plane and containing this point, and <m>Y_2</m> being the whole plane. It is harder to see that it is at most two. This is an example of a variety that fails to be <q>equi-dimensional</q> — the variety has two irreducible components, but they have different dimensions.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Let <m>Y = V(x) \subseteq X</m>, the <m>yz</m>-plane. Then <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Y) = 0</m> since the only closed subsets strictly between <m>Y</m> and <m>X</m> are given by <m>Y</m> together with a finite set of points on the line.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Let <m>Z = V(y,z)</m>, the <m>x</m>-axis. Then <m>\operatorname{codim}_X(Z)</m> is also <m>0</m> by similar reasoning. Since <m>\operatorname{dim}(Z)  = 1</m>, this is a bit counter-intuitive.
